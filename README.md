# Commodity_Price_Prediction
A deep learning Model for Price Prediction of select Commodities
## ðŸ“ˆ Overview

This project demonstrates how to predict the future prices of various commodities using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are well-suited for time series forecasting tasks.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **Multivariate Forecasting:** The model can predict the prices of multiple commodities simultaneously.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data loading, cleaning, and normalization using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.
*   **LSTM Model:** A simple yet effective LSTM model built with `tensorflow.keras`.
*   **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated by comparing the predicted prices with the actual prices.
*   **Visualization:** The results are visualized using `matplotlib`.
